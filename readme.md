# CalendarCountdown

CalendarCountdown is an app that calculates days from current moment to the set end date. Two main features that separate it from the majority of available "countdown" apps currently available are:

- Ability to automatically exclude weekends. This is useful when for example calculating remaining working days until your next holiday.
- Ability to exclude any date ranges from being counted towards the countdown.
- Ability to exclude or include specific days of the week to count toward the number of countdown days.

## Features
- User can set multiple countdowns and see them nicely as a list.
- Widget for showing the value of selected countdowns on home screen.
